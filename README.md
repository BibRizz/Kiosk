# Kiosk Bypass
**Thanks for looking here, hopefully this works for your Chromebook, I'm still gathering technical details to see who this would work for and on what app this works on because this is pretty new and the first bypass I _discovered :)_.**

The kiosk bypass works using a silly mechanic on kiosk apps on ChromeOS, if this takes more than a minimum of 5 clicks with the trackpad (not including the ones to enter the app) to get to the Gmail page/Microsoft page, then write down the process so you don't forget
  There are two methods that I know as of now:
   
>**1) Enter spam:**
      Many kiosk apps have urls for Help/Support/Contact and some have a url they forgot to unlink.
     
>>**a)** Keep looking through random urls until you can get to random websites that own the url, for example, at my school, I discovered a method requiring 15 redirects that start on a password reset page, but your ultimate goal is to find a Gmail address linked to gmail
       
>>**b)** click it, if it sends you to Google sign-in, click the back arrow and click TWICE, if for some reason your Chromebook does not have a back arrow above the number keys, restart and click it TWICE. Idk why but all that matters is if it is clicked an EVEN or ODD number of times, and whether or not you need an even number of click depends on chromebook
       
>>**c)** Now scroll to the very bottom of the Gmail page and click "Google" at the very bottom left corner once. Nothing will happen, that's fine, now spam click the enter key as fast as you can
       
>>**d)** If it worked it would open google.com with ONE tab, everything is unblocked however extensions and chrome:// urls are not avalible
       
>>**e)** Everything is unblocked, navigate with the back, forward, and reload buttons, this, just like Skiovox, saves data, cookies, and cache even after closing it and then re-entering. 
>>>**NOTE**: If you have multiple Gmail support urls, idk if using a diffrent one will create a new independent window
>>>**NOTE**: Just like Skiovox, when you use a new kiosk app, you get a new Google, the same thing happens with this
       
>>**f)** To exit, hold down power for 1 second and click sign out, ctrl+shift+q+q and search+l won't work
>>>**Note**: this method depends on "xxxxxx@xxx.com" type links

>**2)** **Microsoft Sign in:**
> Many testing websites such as Pear Assesment that require a clever sign-in or could _possibly__ redirect you to a Microsoft sign-in page/include a sign-in with Microsoft option are useful here
>>**a)** Like the previous one this takes patience, explore EVERY link, some may be direct like Pear Assesment kiosk, while some might take hours to find, but you need patience considering there hundreds of schools that you have to click on and then hit back key and do it again  before you find a micrsoft page
>>**c)** Congrats, you made it this far! Now  click sign in with Microsoft, click more sign-in options
>>**d)** Press sign in with Github, then press "forgot password"
>>**e)** On the forgot password menu, click the Github logo
>>>**NOTE:** If you press Github logo on previous step because you're trying to be a smartass and skip steps, it won't work 😂 (I tried when I first found out)
>>**f)** Now click the search bar and then search "google.com" or "google"
>>>**NOTE** If you miss-spell or try to search some other browsers it won't work, but if can find one, tell me
>>**g)** If you got this far, hopefully you're smart enough to look at the right 1/3 of Github and notice a url that says "google.com"
>>**h)** If you are still reading, you're really not paying attention to the screen, but here's why you do next: click on the "google.com" :O
**NOTES:**
>This is litteraly just easy Skiovox, but comes at the cost of 1 tab
>I'm gonna keep searching for ways that work for everyone, because I have some friends in other schools who can't use this because of their limited kiosk apps, but if you have any, put it in issues
>If someone can find a universal method, that would be great 👍 also I hope this makes it to 3kh0 Ext Bypasses
